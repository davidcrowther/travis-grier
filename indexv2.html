      <h2>Complying with Canada's New Anti Spam Law</h2>
    </div>

  <section class="intro-info">
    <div class="container">
      <p>According to the new anti spam law, a business that wishes to communicate messages of a commercial nature to customers or business partners in Canada must have express consent to do so. Who's required to receive consent and for what types of electronic messages, however, has some confused about what they need do to comply with the Canada anti spam law, as there are exceptions.</p>

      <h3>What's Considered a Commercial Electronic Message and Could Now be Counted as Spam in Canada?</h3>
      <p>Even if a third party sends out the message on your behalf, the anti spam law regulates all messages that are electronic, sent from or received by a computer in Canada, and encourages the receiver to participate in some form of commercial activity.</p>

      <h3>Actions that are Exempt from the Law</h3>
      <p>Under the new anti spam law in Canada, some parties or actions are exempt from requiring consent:</p>
      <ul class="fs120">
        <li><strong>Businesses:</strong> There are specific instances where electronic messages sent within and to businesses with which there is an existing relationship are exempt in Canada.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal or Family:</strong> Messages of a personal nature or sent between family members are exempt in some cases.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Media:</strong> In some instances, commercial messages posted in social media are exempt.</li>
        <li><strong>SMS:</strong> Certain criteria are required for these types of messages to be excluded.</li>
        <li><strong>Charities &amp; Non-Profit Organizations:</strong> CASL applies, however, if the message is sent by or on behalf of a registered charity to raise funds these actions may be exempt.</li>
        <li><strong>Political Messages:</strong> Politicians and/or political parties in Canada may be exempt from CASL regulations when the purpose of their messages are to solicit contributions.</li>
        <li><strong>Educational Institutions:</strong> If it's a 'core' activity for the institution, CASL may not apply.</li>  
      </ul>
      <p>Remember, this list is general and it's only after seeking legal advice that you can confirm your actions will not be considered spam.</p>
